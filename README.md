# default-beauty.css

> Work in Progress

The idea behind is to beautify a bit default styles whenever you just cannot pay much efforts to styling yet.

Tastes best with [`normalize.css`](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css) or an extended flavoured 
variant of `normalize.css` like [this one](https://github.com/OleksiyRudenko/normalize.css), and
with [a font of your choice](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_google_fonts.asp)
to improve default typography readability.

# default-beauty.css

> Work in Progress

 - [ ] Building quick web page/app prototype?
 - [ ] Want to see anything more pleasant than default
       browser styling from the very first page load?
 - [ ] A beginner focused more on HTML?

 If anything above is what you would tick then this project
 can be of use for you.

The idea behind is to beautify a bit default styles whenever
you just cannot pay much efforts to styling yet.

Tastes best with [`normalize.css`](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css)
or an extended flavoured variant of `normalize.css` like
[this one](https://github.com/OleksiyRudenko/normalize.css), and
with [a font of your choice](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_google_fonts.asp)
to improve default typography readability.

[Check an example](https://oleksiyrudenko.github.io/default-beauty.css/).

Note that [index.html](index.html) contains no style or element class definitions
(with exception of pre-formatted block content).

Feel free changing whatever you like.

Just add &lt;header&gt; and &lt;footer&gt; elements to have distinctive
styling of page header and footer.

If you like it, please, add the following somewhere in the bottom
of your beautified page.

```
<a href="https://github.com/OleksiyRudenko/default-beauty.css">
    Styled with <i class="fas fa-heart"></i> Default-Beuaty.css <i class="fab fa-github-square"></i>
</a>
```
